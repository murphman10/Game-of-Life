# Game-of-Life
This program is a re-creaion of Conway's Game of Life and utilizes the concept of multithreading. These threads maipulate a text file that provides a visual representation of Conway's cells as X's and O's. If the cells are alive, then they are an X, otherwise they are dead and by representation an O.
